Hi, Iâ€™m Visar Berki (@VisarPf), Data Scientist with the Pfizer Innovative Research Laboratory.
Iâ€™m interested in solving problems related to motion capture, using instruments such as the gait walkway, markered and markerless motion capture, and wearables.
 Specifically, I am working to detect gait events and determine gait metrics for the different motion capture systems.

Iâ€™m open to collaborate on SIMI and related motion capture data analysis.
